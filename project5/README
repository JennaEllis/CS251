Project 5: Data Compression 
Jenna Ellis


Compilation Instructions: 
To compile both main programs necessary for grading, please execute the following
    javac -cp .:stdlib.jar BurrowsWheeler.java 
    javac -cp .:stdlib.jar MoveToFront.java
The java files are only dependent upon the stdlib.jar library, and make no use of algs4.jar


Execution: 
To run encode for the Burrows Wheeler Transform, please execute the following
    java -cp .:stdlib.jar BurrowsWheeler - < abra.txt > abra.txt.bwt
In the above example, abra.txt is used to represent all un-modified files that are to be transformed for compression. 
The output is piped to a file with the extension .txt.bwt. 

To run decode for Burrows Wheeler, execute the following: 
    java -cp .:stdlib.jar BurrowsWheeler + <abra.txt.bwt > abra.txt
In which, abra.txt.bwt must be a previously transformed file that was obtained from encode of BWT. 


To run encode and decode for the Move To Front Transform, execute the following: 
    java -cp .:stdlib.jar MoveToFront - <abra.txt > abra.txt.mtf 
    java -cp .:stdlib.jar MoveToFront + <abra.txt.mtf > abra.txt

Error Report: 
No known errors to report at this time.
